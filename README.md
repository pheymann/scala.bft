# Scala.bft
This projects aims to provide scala based implementation of the **B**yzantine **F**ault **T**olerance protocole and furthermore to introduce a **mutli-leader** approach to obtain parallelism and an improved performance.

A short introduction and description of the general idea of how to enable multiple leader is given in the [Wiki](https://github.com/pheymann/scala.bft/wiki) (I write this currently).
